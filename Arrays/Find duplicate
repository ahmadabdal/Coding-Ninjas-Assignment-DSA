Find Duplicate

You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N which contains numbers from 0 to (N - 2). Each number is present at least once. That is,
if N = 5, the array/list constitutes values ranging from 0 to 3 and among these, there is a single integer value that is present twice.
You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.
Solution:
public class Solution{  
    
    public static int duplicateNumber(int arr[]) {
    	//Your code goes here
           int i = 0;   
        
	while(i<arr.length){ 
        int temp=arr[i];
        boolean ans = false;
          for(int j=0;j<arr.length;j++){ 
             if(i==j){
                  continue;
            }
             else if(temp == arr[j]){
                     ans = true; 
                     break;
             }
          }
             if(ans==true){
                 return arr[i];
             }
             i++;
    }
     return -1 ; 
  }
}
