Multiplication (Recursive)

Given two integers M & N, calculate and return their multiplication using recursion. 
You can only use subtraction and addition for your calculation. No other operators are allowed.

Solution:

public class solution {

	public static int multiplyTwoIntegers(int m, int n){
		// Write your code here
	
	
        if(n==0)
            return 0;
        return m+multiplyTwoIntegers(m,n-1);

    }
}
