Calculate Power

Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.
Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)

Solution:
public class Solution {

	public static int power(int x, int n) {
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
		 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
		 */
        if(n==0){
            return 1;
        }
        return (x * power(x,n- 1));
        
		
	}
}
